# Fallback, never rotation

Players can list several models and keys, across providers, in a Fallback list. Every AI call starts at the top of the list and moves down only when an entry cannot answer (Spent, Unusable, or skipped for a short while as busy). We do not spread calls across entries (round-robin, load balancing, "use all keys for throughput"), and the app and wiki never suggest adding keys from several accounts on one provider.

The reason is provider terms. Rotating free-tier keys to multiply a daily allowance looks like getting around a usage limit. Falling back when one allowance runs out, most often from a free key to a paid key or a local model, is an ordinary backup. We want the feature to be the second thing in its code, not only in its marketing. So a PR adding a rotation or throughput mode should be turned down on these grounds, not judged on its code.

## Considered Options

- **Rotation mode as an opt-in setting.** Rejected. Once a quota-multiplying mode is in the code, it is what the feature is known for, whatever the default.
- **Detecting or blocking several keys on one provider.** Rejected. The app cannot see which account a key belongs to, and a player with a free key and a paid key on the same provider is a normal case.
