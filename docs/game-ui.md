# In-Game UI (HUD, Panels & Buttons)

The in-game UI is a flat set of `position: fixed` React components layered over a full-screen MapLibre canvas — there is no single container div, each widget positions itself against the viewport edges and competes for the stacking order through an explicit z-index ladder. `src/Game/GameUI/main.jsx` is the shell: it mounts every HUD element, owns the panel-open booleans, and computes `rightShift` (the horizontal offset that slides the bottom-right cluster left when the advisor drawer opens). Everything the UI reads or writes flows through the runtime state stores (`readJson`/`writeJson`, `readGameData`/`readWorldState`, `useLibraryState`) and the AI layer (`src/Game/AI/*`) — the components hold almost no game data of their own, they poll the stores on a 5-second cadence and push edits back.

- Shell & mount point: `src/App.jsx` (`GameApp`) renders `<UI>` = `src/Game/GameUI/main.jsx` once `isReady`, passing `mapRef`, `isGlobeEnabled`, `isTerrainEnabled`, and their setters.

## 1. The GameUI shell — `src/Game/GameUI/main.jsx`

`Main` is the default export (`src/Game/GameUI/main.jsx:128`). It is mounted by `App.jsx` and **keyed on the active game id** (`key={\`ui-${activeGameId}\`}`, `src/App.jsx:179`) so the entire UI tree remounts when a game activates. That remount is why several open/closed flags live at module scope instead of component state (see [§4.1](#41-menuopendefault--the-remount-trap)).

### 1.1 Props

| Prop | Source | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `mapRef` | `App.jsx` `useRef` handed to `<Map>` | Passed to `DateWidget`, `Toolbar`→n/a, `Search`, `ForcesPanel`; components call `mapRef.current.flyTo/fitBounds/getMap()` to move the camera |
| `isGlobeEnabled` / `setIsGlobeEnabled` | `App.jsx` state (persisted `localStorage["Globe"]`) | Fed to `SettingsMenu`'s **3D Globe** toggle; `App.jsx` re-projects the map |
| `isTerrainEnabled` / `setIsTerrainEnabled` | `App.jsx` state (persisted `localStorage["Terrain"]`) | Fed to `SettingsMenu`'s **3D Terrain** toggle |

### 1.2 Local state in `Main`

| State | Init | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `isSettingsOpen` | `false` | ⋮ settings menu visibility |
| `isCheatsOpen` / `shouldLoadCheats` | `false` | Cheats panel open + lazy-load latch (never imports the chunk until first opened) |
| `isAdvisorOpen` / `shouldLoadAdvisor` | `false` | Advisor drawer open + lazy-load latch |
| `advisorWidth` | `readAdvisorWidth()` | Drawer width in px, persisted (see [§5.1](#51-advisor-width-state)) |
| `isForcesOpen` | `false` | Forces panel open (also opened from the Cheats panel) |
| `activeBottomPanel` | `null` | Which bottom panel (`"chat"`, `"actions"`, `"skip"`, `"history"`) is open — single-slot, so opening one closes another |
| `isFullscreenEnabled` | `false` | Mirrors the Fullscreen API state; persisted `localStorage["Fullscreen"]` |
| `showWebGLWarning` | `false` | Set true if `checkWebGL()` fails on mount → renders `WebGLWarningPopup` |
| `aiSetup` | `readAiSetup()` | `{ ready, provider }`: whether the Fallback list has an entry its provider can call, and the top entry's provider for the start-of-game prompt. Re-read on `ai:fallback-changed` |
| `{ games, loaded }` | `useLibraryState()` | `hasNoGames = loaded && games.length === 0` gates the idle-diplomacy timer |

### 1.3 Side effects owned by the shell

| Effect | Behavior | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| WebGL probe | On mount, `checkWebGL()`; on failure shows the popup | `src/Game/GameUI/main.jsx:55` |
| **Idle diplomacy drip** | Every 60 s, if the tab is visible and a game exists, lazy-imports `../AI/gameplay.js` and calls `maybeSendIdleDiplomacy()` | `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js`; drops a message into the diplomatic chat store unprompted |
| Advisor lazy-load latch | `isAdvisorOpen` → `setShouldLoadAdvisor(true)` (one-way) | Keeps the Chart.js/markdown chunk out of first paint |
| Fullscreen persist + sync | Writes `localStorage["Fullscreen"]`; listens `fullscreenchange`/`webkitfullscreenchange` | `toggleFullscreen()` probes prefixed APIs (mobile Safari safe) |
| AI header + setup | `syncAiDebugContext()` on mount; re-reads `aiSetup` whenever the Fallback list or a Connection changes | `src/Game/AI/providerConfig.js` |
| Advisor-width resize guard | On window `resize`, re-clamps `advisorWidth` so a shrunk window never leaves the drawer wider than the viewport | — |

### 1.4 What `Main` mounts (render order)

`WebGLWarningPopup?` → `LibraryTopBar` → `DateWidget` → `Toolbar` → `Other` → `Search` → `ForcesPanel` → `AdvisorButton` → lazy `AdvisorPanel` → lazy `CheatsPanel` → `SettingsButton` → `SettingsMenu?`.

| Mounted component | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `WebGLWarningPopup` | `main.jsx` (inline) | Full-screen blocker if WebGL is missing |
| `LibraryTopBar` | `libraryBar.jsx` | Main menu + game/scenario editor + country picker + map-editor host + server shutdown |
| `DateWidget` | `time.jsx` | Date/country pill + timeline-skip + event-history panels |
| `Toolbar` | `chat.jsx` | Bottom-left cluster: 💬 Chat + ✦ Actions launchers |
| `Other` | `other.jsx` | Player-country flag badge (desktop only) |
| `Search` | `search.jsx` | Place search (Nominatim) → `map.flyTo` |
| `ForcesPanel` | `forces.jsx` | Unit list + deploy controls + mode banner |
| `AdvisorButton` (🧭) | `main.jsx` (inline) | Toggles the advisor drawer; sits at `rightShift` |
| `AdvisorPanel` | `advisor.jsx` (lazy) | Advisor chat + Stats tabs, resizable drawer |
| `CheatsPanel` | `cheats.jsx` (lazy) | God-mode tools (opened from Settings) |
| `SettingsButton` (☰) | `settings.jsx` | Toggles the game menu; same corner and size as before, glass finish |
| `SettingsMenu` | `settings.jsx` | Ported from kernely's Continuum branch as it is there: a quick menu with Game / Tools / Settings / Help tabs (session card, Game Management, Cheats, Events, AI debug console, Guides, bug report, community links) and `SettingsWorkspace`, a full-screen portal with Continuum's four sections — General, Map (with the basemap picker), AI, Advanced. This branch's own settings (profiles, per-task models, segments, batching, telemetry, beta units, network sharing, diagnostics) sit inside those four sections |
| `ApiSetupPrompt` | `apiSetupPrompt.jsx` | Shown once per game per session when nothing in the Fallback list has what its provider needs (`providerConfig.js isFallbackListConfigured`). The prompt IS the setup: a provider select, the key (or the endpoint for a self-hosted provider) and an optional model, saved by `applyQuickAiSetup` (completes a key-less connection for that provider or adds one, and moves its entry to the top of the list); the `ai:fallback-changed` refresh then hides the prompt. Above the form: an embedded YouTube tutorial on getting a free Gemini key (privacy-enhanced embed, hideable) and a **Get a key at Google AI Studio** button (external link). **Open full settings** opens the game menu on the AI section (`SettingsMenu initialSection`), **Not now** dismisses it |
| `GameLoadingScreen` | `gameLoadingScreen.jsx` | The screen a game opens under: the logo turning over a dark ground until the map is drawn. `useGameLoading` starts loading with every game (this UI is remounted per game), waits for `oh:map-polities-ready` for the game's regions asset (`runtime/mapReadiness.js`; Nations.jsx marks it after the boundary worker answers, or at once on a stock map) and then for the next `oh:map-idle` (World.jsx), with a 60 s ceiling; fades off through `Presence`. Also shown when the 3D globe is switched on or off: App.jsx calls `announceMapRerender()` before the projection state changes, since the map instance is keyed on it and redraws from nothing |

---

## 2. Z-index ladder

Every fixed element declares its own `zIndex`. From back to front (source-verified):

| z-index | Element | File |
|---:|---|---|
| 9997 | In-game floating cluster (session summary pill, **⌂ Exit Game**) | `libraryBar.jsx:1993` / `:2061` |
| 9998 | Timeline panels (`panelSurface`), **Actions** panel, **Chat** panel | `time.jsx:149`, `actions.jsx:427`, `chat.jsx:851` |
| 9999 | `DateWidget` pill, bottom `Toolbar`, `Search`, `Other` flag badge, 🧭 `AdvisorButton`, ⋮ `SettingsButton`, `SettingsMenu`, `ForcesPanel` body, `WebGLWarningPopup` | shared `baseStyle`/`widgetSurface` |
| 10000 | Forces **mode banner** (deploy hint) | `forces.jsx:156` |
| 10028 | "Loading games and scenarios…" indicator | `libraryBar.jsx:2565` |
| 10040 | **Advisor drawer** | `advisor.jsx:320` |
| 10045 | **Cheats panel** | `cheats.jsx:280` |
| 10046 | **Main menu** (full page) | `libraryBar.jsx:2302` |
| 10048 | **Editor drawer** (game/scenario editor) | `libraryBar.jsx:741` |
| 10050 | **Map editor** overlay | `libraryBar.jsx:2125` |
| 10060 | **Country / faction picker** modal | `libraryBar.jsx:2152` |
| 10070 | Cheats **click-capture toast** | `cheats.jsx:256` |
| 20000 | **Server stopped** full-screen overlay | `libraryBar.jsx:2113` |
| 99999 | Chat reaction tooltip (React portal to `document.body`) | `chat.jsx:260` |

Design intent captured in comments: the advisor drawer (10040) sits above every HUD button/panel so nothing covers it on phones, but below the editor/picker/server-down overlays. The editor drawer (10048) deliberately lands **above** the main menu (10046) because the menu's `+`/Edit buttons open it. The in-game cluster sits at 9997 — below the settings menu and date widget (9998/9999) — so opening either covers it rather than the reverse.

---

## 3. Bottom toolbar & diplomacy — `src/Game/GameUI/chat.jsx`

`Toolbar` (`chat.jsx:962`) is the bottom-left 2-button cluster (`bottom/left: 0.5rem`, z 9999). It's memoized and driven by `activePanel`/`onTogglePanel` from `Main`.

| Button | Component | Opens | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 💬 Chat | `Chat` (`chat.jsx:886`) | `ChatPanel` (bottom-left, z 9998) | Unread badge plus incoming-message notifications: one event-driven watcher (runtime JSON writes, `oh:diplomacy-chats-updated`, tab visibility, a 30 s safety interval) keeps a per-chat cursor (`oh:chat-notification-cursors-v2`), toasts a foreign message that lands while its thread is not on screen (top-right, 12 s, click opens the thread), plays a two-note chime (`oh:chat-notification-sound-v1`, 🔊 toggle), keeps a 🔔 notification center bottom-left until the panel opens (bell and toasts stay off the main menu — `useMainMenuOpen` from `libraryBar.jsx`), and can raise desktop notifications once permitted; `window.__OH_DIPLO_NOTIFICATIONS__` (`status`, `test`, `testExistingChat`, `testSound`, `enableDesktop`, `clear`) exercises it |
| ✦ Actions | `Actions` (`actions.jsx:700`) | `ActionsPanel` | See [§7](#7-actions-panel--srcgamegameuiactionsjsx) |

Both launchers use `hasOpened` latches so the panel body isn't mounted until first opened.

### 3.1 ChatPanel (diplomacy)

| Concern | Detail | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Data | `chats` from `readChatsState`/`writeChatsState`; player country + date polled from `JSON_URLS.game` every 5 s | `src/runtime/gameState.js` |
| Country list | `loadCountryNames()` (PMTiles-derived), filtered to exclude the player | `src/runtime/assets.js` |
| Live sync | While open, polls stored chats every 5 s and merges additions (jump invitations, idle drip) without clobbering the active conversation | — |
| Send | `sendDiplomaticMessage(text, countryName, countries)` → `{ reply, reaction, memorySummary }` (the leader appends a hidden `DIPLOMATIC_MEMORY:` line, stored on the reply as `memorySummary` and fed back as system-side context — `runtime/diplomaticEnvelope.js`); multi-country chats rotate speakers via `chooseNextDiplomaticSpeaker`, at most 3 NPC replies per player message | `src/Game/AI/main.jsx`, `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js` |
| Group turn UI | `phase` = `player`/`pending`/`leader`; "Let X speak →" vs "Speak" buttons offer each queued country | `ConversationView` |
| Conversation view | A date separator opens every new game day; the last 12 messages render first with a "Show earlier" button; stacked flags on list rows | `ConversationView`, `ChatListItem` |
| External trigger | `requestDiplomaticChat(country)` bridge (`chat.jsx:697`) lets the map region popup open/reuse a 1-on-1 chat | Map selection layer |
| Reactions | Leader reactions attach an emoji to the player's last message; hover tooltip is a portal at z 99999 | — |

---

## 4. Main menu & library — `src/Game/GameUI/libraryBar.jsx`

`LibraryTopBar` (exported at `libraryBar.jsx:1042`) is a single large component that renders the whole main menu, both editor drawers, the country picker, the map-editor host, and the in-game floating cluster. It subscribes to `useLibraryState()` (`src/runtime/library.js`) for `games`, `scenarios`, `activeGame`, `activeGameId`, `selectedScenarioId`, `countryNames`, `loaded`, `loading`, `error`.

### 4.1 `menuOpenDefault` — the remount trap

`menuOpenDefault` (`libraryBar.jsx:97`) is a **module-scoped boolean**, not state. The whole UI remounts on game activation (App keys on `activeGameId`), so per-component `useState("open")` would reset the menu back open mid game-start. Every open/close goes through `setMenuOpen` (`libraryBar.jsx:1060`), which writes the module var **first**, then the React state. Flows that activate a game (`startGameForCountry`, `handleGameActivate`, `applyMapToScenario`, …) call `setMenuOpen(false)` **before** awaiting the request, so the remounted instance mounts closed over the new game.

- `isMainMenuOpen()` (exported, `libraryBar.jsx:100`) lets background work (e.g. `maybeGeneratePregameHistory` in `time.jsx`) skip while the player is only browsing.
- `openLibraryTab(tab)` (exported, `libraryBar.jsx:89`) + module `_openLibraryTab` bridge lets outside callers open the menu on a specific tab.

### 4.2 Menu chrome

Full-page overlay at z 10046. Header is a 3-column grid: **logo/title** | **tab buttons** | **actions**.

| Tab | Content | Component |
|---|---|---|
| Games | `MenuRow`s: 🕐 Last Played, 🔥 Most Played | `GameCard` |
| Scenarios | 🔥 Most Played, 🕐 Last Updated, ✦ Your Scenarios (with `CreateScenarioTile`) | `ScenarioCard` |
| Community | Lazy `CommunityPanel fullPage` | `communityHub.jsx` |

Header action buttons (right cell): **Refresh** (`refreshLibraryCatalog({force:true})`, hidden on Community), **Import JSON** (Scenarios only → hidden file input `handleImportScenarioFile`).

The Games tab's empty state ("No games yet") offers **Start from a scenario** / **Browse community scenarios** shortcuts.

### 4.3 Menu shelves (derived, memoized)

| Shelf | Sort | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `lastPlayedGames` | `lastPlayedAt` desc | `games` |
| `mostPlayedGames` | `playCount` desc, then `round` | `games` |
| `mostPlayedScenarios` | `playCount` desc, then `gameCount` | `scenarios` |
| `lastUpdatedScenarios` | `updatedAt` desc | `scenarios` |
| `yourScenarios` | filter `!hubOrigin` and not the untouched built-in | `scenarios` |

### 4.4 Cards

**`GameCard`** (`libraryBar.jsx:519`) — cover image + accent gradient; shows country/date/round, pending-action & event counts. Buttons:

| Button | Handler | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Play / Current | `onActivate`→`handleGameActivate` | `activateGame(id)`; closes menu (module flag first) |
| Edit | `onEdit`→`openGameEditor` | `loadGameDetails` → editor drawer |
| Clone Game | `onClone`→`handleGameClone` | `createGame({seedGameId, setActive})` → editor |

**`ScenarioCard`** (`libraryBar.jsx:360`) — asset badges (Cities/Colors/Countries/Regions PMTiles), game count. Buttons:

| Button | Handler | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **New Game** / **⬆ Update** | `onPlay`→`handleScenarioPlay` **or** `onUpdate`→`handleScenarioUpdate` | Update replaces the primary action when a hub-imported, unmodified scenario has a newer bundle upstream (see [§4.7](#47-hub-update-detection)) |
| Edit | `onEdit`→`openScenarioEditor` | `loadScenarioDetails` → editor drawer |
| Clone Scenario | `onClone`→`handleScenarioClone` | `createScenario({seedScenarioId, setActive})` |
| (whole card) | `onSelect`→`selectScenario` | Marks `selectedScenarioId` |

### 4.5 Country / faction picker (New Game flow)

`handleScenarioPlay` (`libraryBar.jsx:1276`) opens a modal (z 10060) instead of starting immediately. Two nested steps:

| Step / state | UI | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| `pickerTab === "country"` | `CountryPickerMap` (lazy OpenLayers) + a country list built by `buildScenarioCountryOptions` (only factions the scenario actually contains: `world.ownerCodes` ∪ `polityOverrides`, incl. landless factions) | `pickCountry(code)` → `difficultyPick` |
| `pickerTab === "faction"` | `FactionCreator` (invent a nation: name/color/lore/flag/regions) | `pickFaction(faction)` → `difficultyPick` |
| `difficultyPick` set | Difficulty grid from `DIFFICULTY_LEVELS` (`src/runtime/difficulty.js`) | `pickDifficulty(id)` |

`pickDifficulty` routes to `startGameForCountry` (new game with country), `startGameForFaction` (new game seeded with an invented polity — merges into `world.polityOverrides`/`regionOwnershipOverrides`/`ownerCodes`, writes colors/flags), or `choosePlayCountry` (Apply-&-Play: `playGameId` set → refines an already-active game). Custom scenario geometry is loaded via `downloadScenarioJsonAsset(id, "regionsGeojson")` so the picker map shows real borders.

### 4.6 Editor drawer (game & scenario editor)

`EditorDrawer` (`libraryBar.jsx:692`) — the fixed right-side form (z 10048, `width: min(34rem, …)`), the primary scenario/game authoring surface. Driven by `editorKind` (`"scenario"`|`"game"`), `editorDetails`, `editorState`, `editorSection`, `promptSectionKey`.

Section tabs (`SectionTabs`): scenarios show `overview | world | features | prompts | assets | bundles`; games drop `bundles`.

| Section | Fields | Writes via |
|---|---|---|
| overview | Name, Eyebrow, Accent (color), Subtitle, Description, Hero Title, Hero Subtitle | `saveScenario`/`saveGame` meta |
| world | Player Country, Game Date, Language, **Deployable Troop Types** (scenario only, `UNIT_TYPES` toggles), World Before Round One (`startingTimelineText`), Simulation Rules, Country Label Font/Letter Color/Border Color | merged into `world` |
| features | `FeaturesSectionEditor` (`FeaturesSectionEditor.jsx`): one card per entry of `FEATURE_DEFINITIONS` (`server/gameFeatures.js`) — today Espionage, and Idle diplomacy with its "one attempt every N minutes" setting. A scenario edits its complete configuration (On/Off + settings), the default for every game made from it; a game edits only overrides, each control offering **Scenario default** so an unset field keeps following the scenario, including changes made to the scenario later (`resolveFeatures`). The library resolves the active game's features into `src/runtime/gameFeatures.js` (`useActiveFeatures` for the UI, `isActiveFeatureEnabled` for the simulation): espionage off hides the Spy tab and stops spy reports, intercept refreshes, the turn's espionage resolution and the simulator's spy orders; idle diplomacy's setting sets the per-minute chance of `maybeSendIdleDiplomacy`'s chat half (off keeps only the movement pulse). Scenario and game bundles carry `features`. | `saveScenario`/`saveGame` meta `features` (`readScenarioMeta`/`readGameMeta` normalise it on both stores) |
| prompts | `PromptSectionEditor`: one tab per section of `PROMPT_EDITOR_SECTIONS` (the prompts with guidance), and inside it one textarea per guidance passage declared in `promptGuidance.js` (the role, the tone, what to simulate, what makes a good event…) with **Reset to default** per passage and per section. The technical text — placeholders, output contracts, map rules — is never shown or stored, so it cannot be broken here and it follows the app's defaults as they change; a pack in the old whole-prompt shape is ignored (ai-prompts.md §2). | `serializePromptPack` → `prompts` as `{ promptModel: 2, guidance }` |
| assets | Upload/Reset per asset (cover; scenario adds cities/colors/countries/regions) via hidden file inputs | `uploadScenarioAsset`/`clearScenarioAsset` etc. |
| bundles | **Download .zip** / **Download JSON** (`exportScenarioBundle` + `splitScenarioBundleImage`) | disk download |

Footer: **Save** (`handleSave`), **🗺️ Open Map Editor** (scenario only — loads current geometry/owners/cities/palette/flags/background then opens the lazy `MapEditor` at z 10050; on apply → `applyMapToScenario`), **Delete** (if `record.canDelete`, `window.confirm`).

Save is careful: scenario/game meta writes merge `currentGame`/`currentWorld` so a partial write never wipes `startDate`/`gameDate`/`round` or `polityOverrides`/`ownerCodes` (the "Undated" and wiped-map bugs called out in comments).

### 4.7 Hub update detection

When the Scenarios tab shows any scenario carrying `hubOrigin`, an effect (`libraryBar.jsx:1308`) lazy-imports `communityHub.jsx`'s `fetchHubPosts()` and builds `hubPostById`. `scenarioUpdateAvailable(scenario)` returns true when the post's current `bundleUrl` differs from the imported one → the card's primary button flips to **⬆ Update**. `handleScenarioUpdate` calls `downloadHubBundle` + `updateScenarioFromBundle(id, bundle)`, replacing the copy in place (existing games keep working).

### 4.8 In-game floating cluster & server shutdown

When the menu is closed, `LibraryTopBar` renders a compact cluster (z 9997): a session-summary pill (`summaryText` = name / country / date), **⌂ Exit Game** (→ `setMenuOpen(true)`). Desktop lays them out top-left of the date widget; phones put **⌂** in the left gutter. The ⏻ server-shutdown button that used to sit beside it is gone from the beta; `POST /api/server/shutdown` stays for scripts and the launcher.

---

## 5. Advisor drawer & stats — `src/Game/GameUI/advisor.jsx` + `stats.jsx`

`AdvisorPanel` (`advisor.jsx:186`) is the right-docked drawer (z 10040, full `100vh`). It slides in/out via `transform: translateX(...)` (a prior `right: calc(-min()…)` was invalid CSS and silently never slid). Two tabs, both kept mounted so flipping is instant:

| Tab | Component | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 🧭 Advisor | inline chat | Loads/saves history to `JSON_URLS.advisor`; `startChat()`/`loadHistory()` bootstrap; `sendMessage(text)` → advisor reply. Renders markdown (`react-markdown`) and inline ` ```chart ` blocks via `AdvisorChart` (Chart.js). 🗑 clears the chat; ✕ closes (the only exit on phones where the drawer covers 🧭) |
| 📊 Stats | `StatsPane` | National stat sheet (see [§5.2](#52-statspane--srcgamegameuistatsjsx)) |

### 5.1 Advisor width state

The drawer is user-resizable by dragging its **left edge**. Width lives in `Main` as px (drag maps 1:1 to the pointer):

| Constant / fn | Value / behavior | File |
|---|---|---|
| `ADVISOR_MIN_WIDTH` | `280` | `main.jsx:21` |
| `ADVISOR_DEFAULT_WIDTH` | `320` (the old fixed 20rem) | `main.jsx:22` |
| `clampAdvisorWidth(px)` | clamps to `[min(280, vw−16), vw−16]` | `main.jsx:23` |
| `readAdvisorWidth()` | reads `localStorage["oh-advisor-width"]`, else default | `main.jsx:27` |
| `handleAdvisorResize(px)` | sets state + writes `localStorage["oh-advisor-width"]` | `main.jsx:238` |

The drag handler lives in the drawer (`advisor.jsx:202`): on `pointerdown` it captures the pointer and, on each `pointermove`, calls `onResize(window.innerWidth - ev.clientX)` (docked right, so width = viewport − pointer x). `Main` clamps + persists. `rightShift = isAdvisorOpen ? \`calc(${advisorWidth}px + 0.5rem)\` : "0.5rem"` (`main.jsx:253`) is passed to the date widget, the flag badge (`Other`), and the 🧭 button so they slide left exactly the drawer's width when it's open.

### 5.2 `StatsPane` — `src/Game/GameUI/stats.jsx`

| Concern | Detail | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Target | `targetCountry` seeds from the player's country; **clicking any country on the map** re-targets it (`setRegionClickObserver`) | `src/Game/Selection/Regions.jsx` |
| Data | `generateCountryStatSheet({code, name})` (AI), validated by `validateGameplayPayload("countryStatSheet", …)` | `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js`, `gameplaySchemas.js` |
| Caching | Per `gameKey:code`, keyed by game date; memory + `localStorage["oh-stat-sheets"]` (cap 60); regenerated when the date moves; ↻ forces regen | — |
| Render | Flag/initials header, national stability bar, 6 strategic indices (`INDEX_ROWS`), economy cards (`compactEconomyValue` trims 30000000000→30.0B), GDP breakdown bar | — |
| Flag logic | author flag (`flags.json`) > polity flag > code-derived — but a **landless player** never borrows a code-derived flag (`isPolityLandless`) | `src/runtime/countryFlags.js` |

`Other` (`other.jsx`) is the standalone player-country flag badge at bottom-right (desktop only; hidden on mobile because the date widget already shows the country). It polls `JSON_URLS.game` + world every 5 s and applies the same landless-suppression logic; falls back emoji → `FallbackBadge` initials for non-ISO polities.

---

## 6. Date widget & timeline — `src/Game/GameUI/time.jsx`

`DateWidget` (`time.jsx:1226`) is the top-right pill (z 9999) plus two slide-up panels (z 9998). It's the time-advance control center.

### 6.1 The pill

Shows player country + formatted date (`«` opens Events history, `»` opens the Skip panel; `»` becomes a spinner during a jump). `rightShift`/`topOffset` come from `Main`. Polls `readGameData`/`readEventsState`/`readWorldState` every 5 s, but **never regresses** — a stale poll with a lower round/date than what's on screen is skipped (`gameStampRef`), so a just-completed jump is never reverted.

### 6.2 Timeline skip panel (`»`)

| Control | Effect | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed jumps (6h…1yr) | `runJump(days, "jump")` → `simulateTimelineJump` | `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js` |
| Custom amount + unit | same, arbitrary days | — |
| **Auto-jump** | `runJump(365, "auto")` → `simulateAutoJump` (AI picks how far) | — |
| **↩ Undo last turn** | `runUndo()` → `rollBackToSnapshot(0)`; `undoCount` from `loadRollbackSnapshots` | rollback snapshots |
| Cancel (during load) | `cancelJump()` aborts the in-flight `AbortController` | — |

On success it swaps to the **history panel** with `visibleEventCount = 1`. Fallback generations surface a warning banner.

### 6.3 Event history panel (`«`) + staged reveal

Renders the latest turn's events (`buildTurnRecord`) one at a time; **Next event** / **Skip to end** reveal more. The camera follows every revealed event (`deriveEventFocusBounds` → `focusMapOnBounds`), unless the **Disable camera movement during events** map setting is on. A **staged reveal** (`time.jsx:1558`) replays the pre-jump world from the rollback snapshot and applies only revealed events' impacts through a purely visual override (`setWorldStateOverride`/`setUnitsOverride`) so ownership/units/markers animate in; finishing/closing clears the override.

Each card's **N map changes** pill is a button: it opens a *What changed on the map* list under the card (`describeEventMapChanges`, `time.jsx`) — one line per territory transfer, control or contest change, claim, polity change (create / rename / restore / dissolve / update), unit spawn / move / strength / removal and structure build / update / rename / removal, with polity, region and unit names resolved (`resolvePolityName`, `resolveRegionName`, `getUnitById`). The count on the pill is the length of that list, so the two never disagree.

### 6.4 Pregame history

If a fresh game (round 1, no events/turns) has a "World Before Round One" briefing and the menu is closed, `maybeGeneratePregameHistory()` runs once (`time.jsx:1351`). The `isMainMenuOpen()` gate ensures tokens aren't spent on a game the player is only hovering past in the menu.

## 7. Actions panel — `src/Game/GameUI/actions.jsx`

`ActionsPanel` (`actions.jsx:225`) — bottom-left slide-up (z 9998). The player's planned-action queue for the current turn. An order that deploys or recalls a spy ("deploy a spy in Germany") is executed by the next time skip through the event's `impacts.spyOps` ([Espionage Orders] in `docs/ai-prompts.md`); the Spy tab still shows and manages the agents.

| Control | Effect | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Composer (textarea) + ✈ send | `createManualAction` → `writeActionsState` | `src/runtime/gameState.js` |
| ✦ sparkle | `refinePlayerAction(text)` rewrites the draft in place (no persist) | `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js` |
| **Help brainstorm actions** | `onOpenAdvisor` (opens the advisor drawer) | `Main.openAdvisor` |
| **Get/Refresh AI suggestions** | `generateActionSuggestions({force:true})` → `SuggestionCard`s | AI |
| Queue a suggestion | `normalizeSuggestionAction` → persisted; button flips to "✓ Queued" | — |
| Delete an action | `handleDelete`; if it was a queued unit order (`unitRevert`, still `planned`), also `revertUnitOrder` to undo its map effect | `src/Game/Map/unitsController.js` |

Only `status === "planned"` actions render. Country + date poll `JSON_URLS.game` every 5 s (display only). The launcher button (`Actions`, `actions.jsx:700`) lives in the toolbar.

## 7-bis. Projects & Operations panel — `src/Game/GameUI/projects.jsx`

`ProjectsPanel` (`projects.jsx:697`) — bottom-left slide-up (z 9998), the third `activePanel` slot after Chat and Actions. Its launcher `Projects` (the `ProjectsDockIcon` glyph) sits in the same `Toolbar` (`chat.jsx:2962`), which widened to hold three buttons (`12.8rem` at this commit). Entries are created and edited by the AI, by design; the player owns exactly two things on the board — a project's priority (`PrioritySwitch`) and whether to abandon it — see [World state](world-state.md) §2e-bis.

| Element | Behavior | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Data | Its own 5 s `setInterval` while open: `readWorldState({force:true})` + `JSON_URLS.game`, signature-gated so a poll that changed nothing does not re-render the list under the cursor | `src/runtime/gameState.js` |
| Cards | Kind glyph, name, status pill, owner, summary, tag chips, progress bar (`Bar`, copied from `stats.jsx:153`), timeline row, next milestone, last update | — |
| Derived badges | ⚠ Overdue / ⏳ Due in Nd / Milestone slipped / No recent progress — all from `deriveProjectFlags` against the game clock, never from what the model wrote, so they cannot go stale | `src/runtime/projects.js` |
| Sort & filter | `PROJECT_SORTS` dropdown, Mine/Foreign/All, and tag chips built from the live vocabulary (`collectProjectTags`). Open work always sorts above closed work whatever the chosen sort |
| Closed view | An **exclusive** switch, not an "also include" filter: off shows only running work, on shows only completed/failed/cancelled. It previously widened the list to everything, which — because the sort ranks open above closed — buried the closed entries under a screen of active ones and made the button look broken. `isProjectClosed` (`runtime/projects.js`) is the one definition the filter, the count and the sort all share | `src/runtime/projects.js` |
| **🧭 Ask advisor** | `onOpenAdvisor(seed)` — opens the drawer with a per-project brief request **pre-filled, never sent**; the same path the Actions panel's "Help brainstorm actions" button uses | `Main.openAdvisor` |
| **📍 Show on map** | Resolves `project.focus` → first linked marker → first linked unit, then `map.flyTo`. Hidden entirely when nothing resolves, rather than offered and inert | `mapRef`, threaded through `Toolbar` |
| Activity feed | Expanding a card resolves `project.eventIds` against `readEventsState()`, fetched **once and only after a first expand** — `events.json` is the largest runtime document and most opens never expand anything | `src/runtime/gameState.js` |
| Empty state | The **backfill path**, not a dead end: a button seeding the advisor with "put my ongoing efforts on the board". An existing campaign's history is already in the advisor's prompt, so it can reconstruct one | — |

Two authors create the board's entries (the player only sets a priority or abandons one): events through `impacts.projectOps` — supplied by the separate `projects` AI task after a jump, or inline by the game master — and the advisor through a ```` ```projects ```` block — `applyAdvisorProjects` in `advisor.jsx`, with an `AdvisorProjectsCard` receipt, the same "advisor creates, I review" contract as ```` ```actions ````. The advisor's write does a read-modify-write that spreads the **whole** world back; a shallow patch there would drop `polityOverrides`/`regionOwnershipOverrides` and blank the map.

## 8. Forces panel — `src/Game/GameUI/forces.jsx`

`ForcesPanel` (`forces.jsx:85`) — bottom-left panel (z 9999), a **controlled** component (open state owned by `Main.isForcesOpen`; opened from the toolbar historically, now primarily from the Cheats panel's "Manual force deployment"). Manual troop control is treated as a cheat.

| Element | Behavior | Connects to |
|---|---|---|
| Unit list | `subscribeUnits`/`getUnits`; split into "Your units" (`getPlayerCode`) and dimmed "Other forces". Clicking a unit `flyTo`s it | `src/Game/Map/unitsController.js` |
| Deploy controls | type (restricted by scenario `getAllowedUnitTypes()`), strength (1–1000), optional name → `setInteractionMode({kind:"deploy", params})` then closes the panel | unitsController |
| **Mode banner** (z 10000) | Global hint while `mode.kind !== "idle"` (deploy) + Cancel (`clearInteractionMode`) | interaction-mode state |

Owner codes render as full names via `ensurePolityNames`/`polityDisplayName` (re-renders once the lookup warms). `TYPE_GLYPH`/`TYPE_LABEL` map unit types to icons/labels; strength color-codes >600 green / >250 amber / else red.

## 9. Cheats panel — `src/Game/GameUI/cheats.jsx`

`CheatsPanel` (`cheats.jsx:164`) — right-side panel (z 10045), opened from Settings → 🧪 Cheats (lazy-loaded). A list of tools (`TOOLS`); selecting one renders `ToolView`. Several tools enter **click-capture mode**: the panel hides behind a toast (z 10070) and map clicks route through `setRegionClickInterceptor` instead of opening the region popup.

| Tool id | Does | Writes / calls |
|---|---|---|
| `master-ai` | **GM Console**: a natural-language request in one of three modes (direct correction, exact event, world intervention) is planned by the AI into a structured transaction, shown operation by operation, and only then applied | `previewGameMasterCommand(text, { mode })` → `applyGameMasterPreview(preview)` (`src/Game/AI/gameplay.js`). Apply revalidates the preview against a fresh world, fails closed if canonical state changed since the preview (fingerprint), writes through the event-impact seam plus the war/diplomatic ledgers and the Stats seam, links the events into the Events panel, and records `world.gmAudit`. Direct prose execution (`applyGameMasterCommand`) is disabled. |
| `events` | **Event Editor**: search, create ("exact events"), edit and delete canonical events with quotations and metadata; an exact event may allow one NPC diplomatic reaction after a 12-second undo window | `writeEventsState`; manual events are linked into `world.simulationHistory`; reactions queue in `world.pendingEventOutreach` and are evaluated by `processPendingEventOutreach` (scheduled from the chat panel) |
| `history-document` | **History Document**: the living history the AI is shown in place of the folded events — read and edit it, fold the older events now, or reset compression; the timeline keeps every event in full | `world.historyDocument` and `world.consolidatedHistory` via `writeWorldState`; `consolidateHistoryNow` (`gameplay.js`) runs the `eventConsolidator` task on everything but the newest 24 events (`historyConsolidation.js` decides what a pass folds and how the document is revised) |
| `roll-back-turn` | Restore to the start of an earlier turn (discards later turns) | reads `JSON_URLS.snapshots`; writes game/world/events/actions/chat/colors |
| `your-country` | Switch which country you play | `writeGameData({…country})` |
| `difficulty` | Set difficulty (Difficulty 2.0: per-scope directives for simulation, diplomacy and catalysts) | `writeGameData({…difficulty})` (`DIFFICULTY_LEVELS`, `src/runtime/difficulty.js`) |
| `annex-country` | Click a country → fold all its regions into a target | resolves current owner via overrides + `loadRegionCatalog`; writes `regionOwnershipOverrides` |
| `annex-regions` | Click individual regions → transfer to a target | per-region `regionOwnershipOverrides` write |
| `edit-country` / `add-country` | **Country Editor** (identity, colour, tags, reputation, the persistent stat sheet) or create a polity (name **is** the identifier) | `polityOverrides` + `colors.json`; stats through `applyCountryStatPatchToWorld` |
| `regions` | **Region Inspector**: click a region → controller, lawful sovereign, claimants, provenance; change de-facto control (a control op), restore sovereign control, transfer legal sovereignty (a transfer), add/withdraw claims; rename on custom-geometry maps | `applyEventImpactsToWorld` with `regionTransfers` / `regionClaims` (the same seam events use); name via `regionsGeojson` |
| `edit-feature` / `add-feature` / `clear-features` | **Map Feature Editor**: runtime features (`world.markers`, with lifecycle status, owner, kind, location) and scenario cities | marker ops through `applyEventImpactsToWorld`; `citiesGeojson`; adding the first custom city flips `customCities: true` |

The log viewer that used to be a Cheats tool is now **View log** in Settings → Diagnostics (section 10).

Ownership/name resolution is done in **one namespace** (country display name) — the file's comments call out the recurring bug where a GADM code (`RUS`) and a name (`Russia`) never compared equal. All map changes repaint within ~5 s (the map's own poll).

`loadPolities()` (`cheats.jsx:103`) enumerates the countries actually in the game (polity overrides ∪ current region owners ∪ owners of rendered geometry — custom regions when present, else the stock catalog), each resolved to a display name.

## 10. Settings — `src/Game/GameUI/settings.jsx`

`SettingsButton` (⋮, `settings.jsx:709`) sits top-left (z 9999); toggles `SettingsMenu` (`settings.jsx:727`), a scrollable panel below it.

| Section | Control | Persists to / calls |
|---|---|---|
| Models | `FallbackListSection` — the Fallback list: one row per entry with its status (ready / Spent until … / Unusable: reason / busy, back in …) and when it last answered; reorder, edit, reset, remove; **Add a backup**, **Fill…** (`FillPanel`), and the rate-limit choice. With one entry it is the old single form: provider (`ApiProviderSelector`), key or endpoint, model. See `docs/ai-overview.md` | `providerConfig.js` (`addEntry`, `updateEntry`, `moveEntry`, `fillFallbackList`, `setRateLimitPolicy`…) |
| Connections | `ConnectionsSection` — saved provider + name + key + endpoint + custom parameters (+ **Strict tool schema** for OpenAI Compatible); templates for Groq, OpenRouter, Local Ollama | `addConnection`, `updateConnection`, `removeConnection` |
| Model reasoning | `ReasoningSection` — the global **Model reasoning** toggle | `setReasoningEnabled` |
| Language | `LanguageSelector` — searchable; applying reloads the page | `setStoredLanguage` (server + browser) |
| Display | **Fullscreen**, **3D Globe**, **3D Terrain** (labeled "Very Experimental") toggles | `Main` toggles / `App.jsx` state |
| Map | Hide country labels, **Reduce motion** (umbrella over the two below), Disable idle globe rotation, Disable camera movement during events | `setMapSetting(MAP_SETTING_KEYS.*)` (`src/runtime/mapSettings.js`) |
| AI | **Limit AI generation** (off by default; 5-min silence cap then canned fallback vs. wait-as-long-as-needed); **Generate long time skips in segments** (off by default); **AI lookup functions** (on by default: the model may call lookup functions before answering, see `docs/ai-overview.md`); **Batch background AI tasks** (Anthropic only, off by default — the event consolidator rides the Message Batches API, see `docs/ai-overview.md`) | `MAP_SETTING_KEYS.limitAiGeneration`, `MAP_SETTING_KEYS.batchBackgroundTasks`; **Record AI telemetry** / **Rate AI generations** (`telemetry.js`; recording on, rating off by default) and the **📊 AI debug console** button (`debugConsole.jsx`, lazy; see `docs/ai-overview.md`) |
| Diagnostics | `DiagnosticsPanel` — **📋 Copy log** / **💾 Save as file** (the Logging file, Desktop log merged in), **🔎 View log** (`DiagnosticsLogViewer`: the same entries, newest first, problems-only filter, click to expand), Clear, and the **Keep a diagnostics log** / **Detailed logging** switches | `buildLoggingFile` / `getLoggingFileEntries` / `setDebugLogEnabled` / `setDebugLogVerbose` (`src/runtime/debugLog.js`, see `docs/runtime-services.md`) |
| Footer | **🧪 Cheats** (→ `onOpenCheats`), **📖 Guides** (`/guides/`), Discord/Reddit/GitHub links | — |

`Toggle` (`settings.jsx:156`) is the shared switch primitive (also exported). Map-setting toggles read initial values from `getMapSetting` and mirror them locally.

---

## 11. Search — `src/Game/GameUI/search.jsx`

`Search` (`search.jsx:144`, memoized) — collapsed 3rem circle just right of the toolbar (z 9999), expands to an input (rightward on desktop, full-width above the toolbar on mobile). Debounced (200 ms) autocomplete against **Nominatim** (`nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`), results deduped + cached in-module. Picking a result (click / Enter / ↑↓) calls `mapRef.current.flyTo({center:[lon,lat], zoom:5})`. Purely a camera control — it does not touch game state.

---

## 12. Legacy: `src/Game/GameUI/scenarios.jsx`

`ScenarioTopBar` (`scenarios.jsx:686`) is an **older, standalone** scenario deck + editor (full-width top bar z 10030, deck z 10029, editor z 10031) that reads from a separate `../../runtime/scenarios.js` store (`useScenarioState`) rather than `library.js`. It is **not imported anywhere** in `src/` — it has been superseded by `LibraryTopBar` + `EditorDrawer` in `libraryBar.jsx`. Its `ScenarioEditor` still shows the older flat prompt fields (Advisor Prompt / Leader Prompt / **Advanced AI Prompt Pack** JSON textarea) rather than the sectioned `PromptSectionEditor`. Treat it as reference/dead code unless you're wiring the old top-bar mode back in; new work goes in `libraryBar.jsx`.

## 14. Shared conventions

- **Surface styling**: most HUD elements share a `baseStyle`/`surface` object — `rgba(17,24,39,0.9)` bg, `backdrop-filter: blur`, 12px radius, subtle border/shadow. The main menu/editor use `surfaceStyle` (darker gradient + heavier blur).
- **5-second polling**: Chat, Actions, Stats, `Other`, and `DateWidget` each run their own `setInterval(refresh, 5000)` against the runtime stores rather than sharing a subscription — the map's own poll then repaints ownership within ~5 s of any cheat/edit.
- **`data-no-translate`**: player-typed text, economic figures, and raw dropdown values are marked so the UI translator ([i18n](i18n.md)) leaves them verbatim.
- **Mobile branching**: `useIsMobile()` (`src/runtime/useIsMobile.js`) reshapes the search box, the date/country row, the exit cluster, and menu paddings. The advisor drawer and bottom panels clamp to `calc(100vw − …)`.
- **Lazy chunks**: advisor (Chart.js + markdown), cheats, community hub, the map editor, and the OpenLayers country picker are all `React.lazy` — none are in the first paint.
