// The Android app IS the web build. It used to be a thin WebView that asked for
// the address of a server the player had to run themselves — Termux on the same
// phone, or a machine on their network — and then navigated to it. Now it ships
// the same bundle openhistoria.com serves, which connects to a community content
// node on its own, so there is nothing to install and nothing to type.
//
// This copies dist-web/ into mobile/www/ (Capacitor's webDir), which is why
// nothing in mobile/www is committed except its .gitignore.
