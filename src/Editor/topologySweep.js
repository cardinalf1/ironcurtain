// Every scenario save (Save, Save & Exit, Apply & Play) first runs the Topology
// panel's conservative repair over EVERY region — enclosed cracks narrower than
// 500 m filled, thin overlaps trimmed — before the map is written
// (MapEditor.jsx persistScenario → OlMap.jsx repairTopologyEverywhere). This
// module is the pure part: how regions are grouped for the staged union, and
// what the loading screen says.
//
// The pass is not all-pairs. Overlap discovery asks the map's spatial index for
// extent neighbours only (the stock 4,848-region world: 14,011 pairs, ~3 s),
// and the gap search reads the holes of ONE union of every region on the map.
// That union is built in stages — each chunk of regions unioned, then the chunk
// results unioned — which is the same polygon set as a single call (union is
// associative; the stock world yields the identical 324 cracks crack by crack)
// with bounded memory (414 MB → ~200 MB of heap on the stock world) and a
// repaint between chunks. Searching each chunk on its own was rejected: a crack
// longer than a chunk, such as a double-traced border between two large
// countries, can have both end-caps outside any one chunk and go unseen.
//
// Two more measured facts shape the pass. Trimming a sliver can expose a
// hairline between the winner and a third region the trimmed region used to
// cover, so the pass repeats until it finds nothing (the stock world: 98
// cracks and 57 slivers, then nothing). And the save writes coordinates at
// five decimals, about a metre, which leaves centimetre slivers along every
// repaired border on reload — without a floor those would be "repaired" again
// on every save, moving hundreds of regions by centimetres each time.
