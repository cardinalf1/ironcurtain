// The Fallback list's rules, in one place (docs/world-state.md, "AI access").
//
// Every AI call starts at the top of the player's Fallback list and uses the
// first entry that can answer. It moves down only when an entry cannot: it is
// Spent, Unusable, or busy for a moment. It never spreads calls across entries
// to get more usage — see docs/adr/0001-fallback-never-rotation.md before
// changing anything about the order.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, like providerErrors.js: main.jsx makes the calls and
// cannot be unit-tested, and these rules are exactly what needs to be. The
// caller hands in the list, where entry states are kept, a clock, and one
// function that makes one call on one entry.

// Remembers entry states in memory, for the tests. The game keeps the real one
// in localStorage (providerConfig.js fallbackStateStore); both have this shape.
