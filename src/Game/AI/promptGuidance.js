/*! Open Historia — the editable guidance inside each system prompt © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// Every system prompt is a fixed technical template that the game depends on —
// the placeholders that inject the world, the output contracts, the map rules —
// with a few passages of GUIDANCE inside it: the role, the tone, what to
// simulate and how much, what makes a good event. Only the guidance is shown
// and editable in the scenario and game editors; the technical text is never
// stored anywhere but here, so a change to it reaches every scenario and game.
//
// A segment is located in its default prompt (defaultPrompts.json) by a short
// `start` and `end` anchor, both copied verbatim from that text: the segment is
// the text from the first character of `start` to the last of `end`. A
// prompt's segments must appear in order and must not overlap
// (promptGuidance.test.js checks every one). Composing a prompt replaces each
// segment's default text with the author's, and nothing else moves — so an
// unedited pack renders byte-for-byte the prompt the game ships with.
//
// The registry key is the prompt's section key: "advisor", "leader", or a task
// key. A prompt with no entry here has no guidance and does not appear in the
// editor; the model-facing tasks (curator, directors, resolver, stat sheet,
// spy desks, the board) are entirely technical by design.
