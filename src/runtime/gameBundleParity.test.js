// Run: node --test src/runtime/gameBundleParity.test.js
//
// A Game exported in the browser has to import on a desktop install and back —
// that is the whole reason the zip is assembled client-side. Two stores build
// that bundle: server/libraryStore.js for desktop and Android, and
// src/runtime/web/libraryStore.js for the web build's IndexedDB.
//
// They cannot share code (one is Node with a filesystem, the other is a browser
// with an object store), so they share a contract instead, and this is what
// holds them to it. A key added to one list and not the other is silent: the
// export still succeeds, the import still succeeds, and one file quietly stops
// carrying a piece of the campaign.
//
// What this does NOT cover: an actual round trip through the web store, which
// needs an IndexedDB harness this repo does not have (no fake-indexeddb, no
// existing test touches web/libraryStore.js). Nor whether web's `default`
// scenario is the same world as desktop's — see .scratch/save-export-zip/spec.md §9.
